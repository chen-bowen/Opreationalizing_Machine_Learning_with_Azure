# Opreationalizing Machine Learning with Azure

## Project Overview

In this project, we will use the hybrid of Azure Machine Learning SDK and Azure Machine Learning Studio's webUI. We will start by creating an autoML experiment on the bank marketing prediction dataset and let Azure ML pick the best model for us. Then we will publish the pipeline as an endpoint, which will allow us to trigger the same AutoML experiment through JSON payloads. We will then deploy the best model as a webservice endpoint, add retrieve the endpoint's logging, while also benchmark the endpoint. Finally we will utilize swagger to effectively visualize the API endpoint's request and response for better standardization purposes.

## Architectural Diagram
*TODO*: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model". 

## Key Steps
*TODO*: Write a short discription of the key steps. Remeber to include all the screenshots required to demonstrate key steps. 

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
